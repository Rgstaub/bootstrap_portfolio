					    <p>Hello, World! I have created this simple portfolio site to show what I am capable of as a full-stack web developer. It may not be much right now, but I am proud to have gotten this far and excited to discover how much further I can go!</p>
							<br>
							<p>I spent my childhood in New Orleans, LA and moved to Charlotte, NC right before high-school. I attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and later UNC-Charlotte, studying math, physics, and studio art. After leaving college, I bounced around from job to job, hoping to discover my “true calling”. At age 26, I took a job as an administrative assistant with an office furniture dealership. I quickly climbed the ranks and despite having no formal training, I was promoted to Director of Information Technology.</p>
							<br>
							<p>I have been happily married to my lovely and brilliant wife, Susan, for over six years. Our two wonderful daughters, Lillian and Eleanor, are age four and one, respectively. With a dog and two cats in our cozy little home, the environment is often cluttered and chaotic, but could not be more full of love and joy.</p>
							<br>
							<p>I am a die-hard fan of the Carolina Panthers and a certified Star Wars fanatic. Since the age of six, I have been an avid gamer and that passion has not diminished with age. I enjoy reading science-fiction and fantasy novels and listening to political podcasts. My current project is a start-up I created called Team Hearth League (THL). It is an online gaming league and community centered around the online card game, Hearthstone. I created the league two years ago and it has grown to over five hundred members, with about a dozen volunteer employees, several community-run talk shows and competitive broadcasts, weekly tournaments, and countless community-created articles. Upon the completion of the Coding Bootcamp, I look forward to developing a desperately needed website overhaul for Team Hearth League.</p>
							<br>
							<p>I don’t know if web development will be my “true calling” or if that concept even exists for me, however I have enjoyed the start of the start of the Coding Bootcamp immensely. I have always loved creating things and creative problem-solving. I believe my eye for design, my analytical thought-process, and my focus on small details (often referred to as ‘nit-picky’ by my wife and friends), will lend themselves well to being a successful full-stack web developer. Until then, I will KEEP POUNDING (out code).</p>
